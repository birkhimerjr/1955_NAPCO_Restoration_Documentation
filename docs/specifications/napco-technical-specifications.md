## Gear Ratios

### Available Axle Ratios

Both front and rear axles must have matching gear ratios.

| Ratio | Typical Use | Ring/Pinion Teeth |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| 3.73:1 | Highway | 41/11 |
| 4.10:1 | Mixed use | 41/10 |
| 4.56:1 | Off-road/towing | 41/9 |
| 4.88:1 | Heavy off-road | 39/8 |
| 5.38:1 | Crawler | 43/8 |

### Overall Crawl Ratio Calculation

```
Crawl Ratio = Trans 1st Gear × T-Case Low × Axle Ratio

Example with 3-speed trans (2.95:1), NAPCO low (1.94:1), 4.10 axles:
Crawl Ratio = 2.95 × 1.94 × 4.10 = 23.47:1
```
