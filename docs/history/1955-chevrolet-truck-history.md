# 1955 Chevrolet Task Force Trucks

## The Beginning of an Icon

---

## Introduction

The 1955 Chevrolet truck marked one of the most significant redesigns in American truck history. After eight years of the "Advance Design" series (1947-1955 First Series), Chevrolet introduced an all-new truck that would set the standard for the industry.

## The Advance Design Era Ends

### 1947-1955 First Series

The previous generation served Chevrolet well:
- Post-war design that became iconic
- Reliable but aging styling
- Competition from Ford and others demanded change
- Customer expectations had evolved

### Need for Change

By 1954, it was clear a new design was necessary:
- Ford's 1953 F-100 had modern styling
- International and Dodge were competitive
- Post-war prosperity created demand for style
- Trucks were becoming personal vehicles, not just work tools
