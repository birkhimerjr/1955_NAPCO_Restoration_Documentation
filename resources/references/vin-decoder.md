## VIN Format (1947-1955 First Series)

The Advance Design trucks (1947-1955 First Series) used a consistent serial number format throughout the generation.

### Standard Format

```
Example: 3A55-12345

   3A55-12345
   │││  │
   │││  └── Sequential Production Number
   │││
   ││└── Model Year (55 = 1955)
   ││
   │└── Assembly Plant Code
   │
   └── Series (3 = 3000 series trucks)
```

### Alternate Formats

Some trucks may show variations:

**Format A:** `3A55-12345`
**Format B:** `H55A-001234` (transitional to Second Series style)
**Format C:** `3100-A-12345`

---

## Series Designations

### First Digit - Series

| Code | Series | Tonnage | Wheelbase |
|------|--------|---------|-----------|
| **3** | 3000 Series | All trucks | Various |

### Series Breakdown

| Full Series | Description | GVW |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| **3100** | 1/2 Ton, 114" WB | 4,600 lbs |
| **3100** | 1/2 Ton, 123.25" WB | 4,600 lbs |
| **3600** | 3/4 Ton, 123.25" WB | 5,800 lbs |
| **3800** | 1 Ton, 137" WB | 8,600 lbs |

---

## Assembly Plant Codes

| Code | Plant Location | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| **A** | Atlanta, Georgia | |
| **B** | Baltimore, Maryland | |
| **F** | Flint, Michigan | Primary truck plant |
| **J** | Janesville, Wisconsin | |
| **K** | Kansas City, Missouri | |
| **L** | Los Angeles, California | |

## Model Year Identification

| Year Code | Model Year | Production Dates |
|-----------|------------|------------------|
| **54** | 1954 | Late 1953 - Late 1954 |
| **55** | 1955 (First Series) | Late 1954 - March 1955 |

### Important Note

**1955 First Series** trucks were produced from late 1954 through approximately March 1955, when the Second Series (Task Force) was introduced. The serial number year code "55" indicates 1955 model year, but the actual build date may be late 1954 or early 1955.

---

## Production Sequence Numbers

- Sequence numbers are assigned sequentially at each plant
- Numbers typically started at 1001 for each new model year at each plant
- Lower numbers indicate earlier production within the model year

---

## Example Decodings

### Example 1: 3A55-004523
```
3     = 3000 Series (Chevrolet truck)
A     = Atlanta, Georgia assembly plant
55    = 1955 Model Year (First Series)
004523 = Production sequence number

Interpretation: 3000 series truck, built in Atlanta,
1955 First Series, production number 4523
```

### Example 2: 3F55-012876
```
3     = 3000 Series
F     = Flint, Michigan assembly plant
55    = 1955 Model Year
012876 = Production sequence number

Interpretation: 3000 series truck, built at Flint
(main truck plant), 1955 First Series,
production number 12876
```

### Example 3: 3100-J-8754
```
3100  = 1/2 Ton Series designation
J     = Janesville, Wisconsin plant
8754  = Production sequence

Interpretation: 3100 1/2 ton, built at Janesville,
production number 8754
```

## Body Number Plate

## NAPCO Identification

### Transfer Case Tag

NAPCO-equipped trucks have identification on the transfer case:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│         NAPCO               │
│   NORTHWESTERN AUTO PARTS   │
│     MINNEAPOLIS, MINN       │
│                             │
│   MODEL: Spicer             │
│   SERIAL: XXXXX             │
│                             │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Tag Location:** Riveted to transfer case housing

### Front Axle Identification

The Dana 44 front axle may have:
- Dana/Spicer casting numbers on differential housing
- NAPCO-specific component markings
- Date codes cast into housing

### Documentation

Original NAPCO-equipped trucks may have:
- Dealer installation records
- NAPCO warranty card
- Original window sticker mentioning NAPCO
- Service records

*Note: Most NAPCO documentation has been lost over time. Physical inspection of components is the most reliable verification method.*

## Distinguishing First Series from Second Series

### Quick Visual Check

Before decoding, confirm you have a First Series truck:

| Feature | First Series (Advance Design) | Second Series (Task Force) |
|---------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Windshield** | One-piece curved glass | One-piece wraparound |
| **Hood** | Alligator (front-hinged) | Rear-hinged |
| **Grille** | 5 horizontal bars | Egg-crate |
| **Serial Number** | 3X55-##### format | HX55-##### format |

### Serial Number Comparison

**1955 First Series:** `3A55-12345` or `3100-A-12345`
**1955 Second Series:** `H55A-001234`

The Second Series introduced a new format with:
- Letter prefix indicating series (H, J, K, L)
- Two-digit year
- Plant code
- Longer sequence number

---

## Verification Tips

### Cross-Reference All Numbers

For authentication, verify:
1. **VIN plate** matches body plate information
2. **Engine number** is period-correct
3. **Casting dates** predate assembly date
4. **NAPCO serial number** (if equipped) is consistent

### Red Flags

Watch for:
- Re-stamped VIN plates
- Mismatched engine/body numbers
- Components with dates after VIN date
- NAPCO components that don't match truck era

### Professional Verification

For valuable trucks, consider:
- Chevrolet Historical Services (for build records)
- NAPCO registry consultation
- Vintage vehicle appraiser inspection
